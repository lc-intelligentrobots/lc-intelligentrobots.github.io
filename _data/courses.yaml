  description: Learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress in robot control, with applications spanning autonomous driving, quadrupeds, and humanoids. At the core of these advances lie **optimal control** and **reinforcement learning (RL)**. This course develops the mathematical foundations of these methodologies and demonstrates how to apply them to real robotic systems. Topics range from core RL concepts to advanced algorithms (value/policy iteration, TD/Q-learning, actor–critic, DPG/DDPG, TRPO, PPO). The course emphasizes **hands-on practice** so you can use these tools in your own research.
