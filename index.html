    <h1>Learning & Control Lab</h1>
    <p>
      We develop reinforcement learning and optimal control methods with theoretical
      guarantees — stability, robustness, and performance — and deploy them on
      physical systems such as legged robots and autonomous vehicles.

      <h2>About the Lab</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is reliable autonomy in the real world. We build controllers and
        learning algorithms that keep robots stable, safe, and high-performing even
        under uncertainty, time delay, and disturbances.
